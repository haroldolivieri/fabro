## The open source software factory for expert engineers

AI coding agents are powerful but unpredictable. You either babysit every step or review a 50-file diff you don't trust. Arc gives you a middle path: define the process as a graph, let agents execute it, and intervene only where it matters.

## Key Features

|     | Feature                        | Description                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔀  | Deterministic workflow graphs  | Define pipelines in Graphviz DOT with branching, loops, parallelism, and human gates. Diffable, reviewable, version-controlled |
| 🙋  | Human-in-the-loop              | Approval gates pause for human decisions. Steer running agents mid-turn. Interview steps collect structured input |
| 🎨  | Multi-model routing            | CSS-like stylesheets route each node to the right model and provider, with automatic fallback chains  |
| ☁️  | Cloud sandboxes                | Run agents in isolated Daytona cloud VMs with snapshot-based setup, network controls, and automatic cleanup |
| 🔌  | SSH access and preview links   | Shell into running sandboxes with `arc ssh` and expose ports with `arc preview` for live debugging    |
| 🌲  | Git checkpointing              | Every stage commits code changes and execution metadata to Git branches. Resume, revert, or trace any change |
| 📊  | Automatic retros               | Each run generates a retrospective with cost, duration, files touched, and an LLM-written narrative   |
| ⚡  | Comprehensive API              | REST API with SSE event streaming and a React web UI. Run workflows programmatically or as a service  |
| 🦀  | Single binary, no runtime      | One compiled Rust executable with zero dependencies. No Python, no Node, no Docker required           |
| ⚖️  | Open source (MIT)              | Full source code, no vendor lock-in. Self-host, fork, or extend to fit your workflow                  |

## Example Workflow

A plan-approve-implement workflow where a human reviews the plan before the agent writes code:

```dot
digraph PlanImplement {
    graph [
        goal="Plan, approve, implement, and simplify a change"
        model_stylesheet="
            *        { llm_model: claude-haiku-4-5; reasoning_effort: low; }
            .coding  { llm_model: claude-sonnet-4-5; reasoning_effort: high; }
        "
    ]

    start [shape=Mdiamond, label="Start"]
    exit  [shape=Msquare, label="Exit"]

    plan      [label="Plan", prompt="Analyze the goal and codebase. Write a step-by-step plan.", reasoning_effort="high"]
    approve   [shape=hexagon, label="Approve Plan"]
    implement [label="Implement", class="coding", prompt="Read plan.md and implement every step."]
    simplify  [label="Simplify", class="coding", prompt="Review the changes for clarity and correctness."]

    start -> plan -> approve
    approve -> implement [label="[A] Approve"]
    approve -> plan      [label="[R] Revise"]
    implement -> simplify -> exit
}
```

Agents run as multi-turn LLM sessions with tool access. Human gates (`hexagon`) pause for approval. The stylesheet routes planning to a cheap model and coding to a frontier model. See the [DOT language reference](https://arc.dev/reference/dot-language) for the full syntax.
