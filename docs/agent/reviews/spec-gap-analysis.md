# Attractor Spec Gap Analysis

Comparison of the implementation in `crates/attractor/` against `docs/specs/attractor-spec.md`.

## Summary

The core pipeline engine, DOT parsing, edge selection, condition evaluation, retry logic, checkpoint/resume, validation, and all 10 handler types are implemented. The HTTP server with SSE is implemented. Context fidelity preamble synthesis, thread ID plumbing to backends, engine cancellation, recording/replay, and preset retry policies are all implemented. The `should_retry` predicate is customizable via the `Handler` trait. SVG graph rendering via `GET /pipelines/{id}/graph` is implemented. **No remaining gaps.**

## Gaps

### ~~1. GET /pipelines/{id}/graph (SVG Rendering) (Spec 9.5)~~ — RESOLVED

The endpoint is implemented. The DOT source is stored in `ManagedPipeline` and piped through `dot -Tsvg` on request, returning `image/svg+xml`. Returns 502 if graphviz is unavailable, 404 if pipeline not found.

### ~~2. `should_retry` Predicate Customization (Spec 3.6)~~ — RESOLVED

Handlers can now override `should_retry(&self, err: &AttractorError) -> bool` on the `Handler` trait. The default impl delegates to `err.is_retryable()`. The engine's `execute_with_retry` calls the handler method directly. The `ShouldRetryFn` type and `RetryPolicy.should_retry` field have been removed. There's no DOT-level mechanism for per-node retry predicate customization, which matches the spec (no DOT syntax defined for this).

Note: the spec's default predicate description references HTTP status codes (429, 5xx, 401, 403, 400) but the implementation classifies retryability by `AttractorError` variant (`Handler`/`Engine`/`Io` = retryable). Reasonable for Rust but not a 1:1 mapping.

## Spec Contradictions (not implementation gaps)

These items have conflicting definitions within the spec itself. The spec needs to be reconciled; no implementation changes are needed.

### Stylesheet Shape Selectors (Spec 8 vs 11.12)

The grammar (section 8.2) defines `Selector ::= '*' | '#' Identifier | '.' ClassName` — no shape selectors. But the DoD checklist (section 11.12) says "Selectors by shape name work (e.g., `box { ... }`)" and lists a 4-level specificity order including shape. The implementation follows the grammar.

### Orphan Node Severity (Spec 7 vs 11.12)

The validation table (section 7) defines `reachability` as **ERROR**. The DoD checklist (section 11.12) says "Validate: orphan node -> **warning**". The implementation uses ERROR, matching section 7.

## Cross-Feature Parity Matrix Status

Based on code review, these items from Spec 11.12 appear covered:

- [x] Parse simple linear pipeline
- [x] Parse pipeline with graph-level attributes
- [x] Parse multi-line node attributes
- [x] Validate: missing start/exit node -> error
- [x] Execute linear 3-node pipeline end-to-end
- [x] Execute with conditional branching
- [x] Execute with retry on failure
- [x] Goal gate blocks exit when unsatisfied
- [x] Goal gate allows exit when all satisfied
- [x] Wait.human presents choices and routes on selection
- [x] Wait.human with freeform edge routes free-text input
- [x] Edge selection: condition match wins over weight
- [x] Edge selection: weight breaks ties
- [x] Edge selection: lexical tiebreak
- [x] Context updates visible to next node
- [x] Checkpoint save and resume
- [x] Stylesheet applies model override by class/ID
- [x] Prompt variable expansion ($goal)
- [x] Parallel fan-out and fan-in
- [x] Custom handler registration and execution
- [x] Pipeline with 10+ nodes (via integration tests)
- [x] Validate: orphan node -> error (spec contradiction: section 7 says ERROR, DoD says warning; implementation matches section 7)
